Implement the markup and JavaScript to view bookings made by students. The view for bookings should have two levels of detail. The first level shows only a list of dates that have bookings. The second level becomes visible only when a date is clicked and shows a nested list of booking details for the data. Details include the staff name, student email address, and the time booked.

urls:
to get all dates with bookings: /api/bookings  -> success 200 - array of arrays (simple join)
to get all bookings for date: /api/bookings/:date -> success 200 - array of dates

DOM loaded:
- get all dates with bookings
- build and display list of dates

- event listeners on dates (on ul parent)
  - click: get all bookings for date
  - build ul with details of bookings
  - append ul to the li (event.target)

There is no stated requirement to fold when clicking date again (but possible additional functionality)

Pretty straightforward to implemented.
Added functionality to click on the date to fold the details. When the date is clicked again after that, a new fetch is performed, but this is consistent with a web app in which underlying data might have changed between requests.
