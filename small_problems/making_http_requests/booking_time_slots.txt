Implement the markup and JavaScript for booking a schedule. Be sure to check out the documentation on the requirements for a booking.

In the event that the student who's booking the appointment isn't in the database, you must provide a way for the user to create the student, and then automatically proceed with the booking once the student is successfully created.

Assume that only one schedule at a time can be booked.

Page: Form with
1 select element: dropdown of all available schedules:
      - options are staff name | date | time
      - values for options: schedule id
      - info: get all available schedules, filter out those where email is not null
        - /api/schedules returns staff_id, so we will need another fetch to /api/staff_members to match those ids to names (memoize staff info)
        - both of these get requests return json
1 email label/text field
1 submit button in line with email label/field

user Walkthrough:
- select a schedule from drop-down
- enter email
- hit submit POST /api/bookings -
- if student has been registered previously and booked now, success 204
- if schedule does not exist, error 404
- if student not already registered, also error 404 this will return error message, which will contain booking_sequence
  - display a second form to register student
  - form with:
    - header
    - email label and input - email prefilled and send focus to name field (can clone earlier email elements)
    - name label and input
    - booking sequence label and input, pre-filled, not editable
    - button to submit POST /api/students
      - success 201: alert message then go ahead and book the appt after this (booking appt should be its own method), which has an additional alert, then reset page
      - error 403 no booking sequence (should not happen) - alert and don't reset page
      - error 400 empty fields: alert message and do not reset page
