<!-- Implement a function that converts the DOM, starting from the body, to nested arrays. Each element in the DOM is represented as ["PARENT_TAG_NAME", [children]] where children are elements as well and as such follow the same format. When an element has no children, it's represented as ["PARENT_TAG_NAME", []]. For instance, if the HTML doesn't have any elements inside the body, the result array would be: ["BODY", []]. Likewise, if the HTML only has a div element as its content, the result array would be: ["BODY", [["DIV", []]]].

- start point is always document.body
- function takes a node, returns an array of that node's tagname and an array of its children; if no children, returns array of tag name and empty array, and that is the recursion base case
	- recursive: call function for each child node
- then return array result
