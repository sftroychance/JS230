      <figcaption>Hedgehogs are technically members of the rodent family. They are native to Africa, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Hedgehogs were named for their ability to root through the “hedges” for prey. They have quills on their backsides, which they use when threatened. With weak eyesight, hedgehogs use their hearing and sense of smell to root out insects.</figcaption>

      <img src='images/pink_grasshopper.webp'>
      <figcaption>It is common to see green, brown and even white grasshoppers. However, the pink grasshopper is of this color because of a recessive gene that they develop, unlike other grasshoppers. Although there is an isolated case of every 50,000, it is believed that the survival of this type of grasshopper is due to their color. This is mainly because they are no longer attractive to the eyes of predators.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>Native to Africa, these exotic cats have longer legs than your typical domesticated house cat and can run up to 50 mph. Their larger ears make them advanced hunters, and they have been known to close their eyes to better utilize their listening skills.</figcaption>
